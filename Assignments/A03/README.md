## Assignment 3 - Frequency Analysis
### Chad Callender
### Description:

I received two files that were encrypted using a "substitution" cipher. The genius whom encrypted these, randomly shuffled a list of letters multiple times. The problem is, he never sent me the key! So, I cannot reverse the process.

This assignment requires the use of a frequency analysis to decrypt the text files. The process entails comparing the frequency distribution of letters in the English language to those in the text files to "guess" the corresponding plaintext letter in the ciphertext.

### Files

|   #   | File                       | Description                                                |
| :---: | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | [main.py](./main.py)       | Code used to calculate frequency distribution in encrypted files. |
|   2   | [ciphertext_1.txt](./ciphertext_1.txt) | First encrypted text file. |
|   3   | [ciphertext_2.txt](./ciphertext_2.txt) | Second encrypted text file. |
|   4   | [decrypted_1.txt](./decrypted_1.txt)   | Decrypted `ciphertext_1.txt`. |
|   5   | [input_even](./input_even) | Test file to see if any hexograms were even.               |
